On this series, till the fourth day! This is the best UI I'm came across with! 🔥

## 🦄 Results

And again, we have two Screens today, Home and Details page! The code for each screens can be found in the `screes/` directory. For a change, I wanted to show the gif of the results today! The animations looks nicer than I expected.
